        <h1>What is the nature of light waves and what are its properties?</h1>
    <h2>Lightis a form of energy and it can be reflected from objecties and falling on eyes causing the sense of vision</h2>
    <h1>The defenetion of light</h1>
    <h2>It is an external factor that affecting the eye causing the sense of vesion</h2>
    <h1>The defenition of light energy</h1>
    <h2>Light energy is a form of electromagnetic radiation that can be seen by the human eye. Photons are the particles that light is made up of, which are like tiny packets of energy. The Sun is the closest star to the planet Earth and radiates light energy.

    <h1>But wait what is electromagnetic radiation?</h1>
    <h2> Modern theory explains the emission of light in terms of electronic energy levels. Electrons from high energy levels may jump to electrons at a lower energy level and gives off light energy.</h2>
    <h1>What is it made of?</h1>
    <h2> Light has two types of nature It can act as a particle and also a wave
        It is mainly composed of particles which are called as photons. They carry a fixed amount of energy but do not have mass. Therefore the energy of a photon depends on the wavelength Longer wavelength photons possess less energy
        A Wave theory shows that light is an electromagnetic wave containing x-rays, UV rays, infrared rays, gamma rays etc.</h2>

        <h2>Light waves are electromagnetic transverse waves and they are electromagnetic waves because they propagate through vaccum and they are transverse because the medium particles vibrate perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation forming crests and troughs </h2>
        <h3>Light energy is the only visible form of energy. Lots of things about light energy are discussed below</h3>
        <h3>Just asking what is light energy opens you up to a flood of other questions trying to narrow down the context that you are asking the question in. In photometry, luminous energy is the perceived energy of light. It can also be defined as the electromagnetic radiation of visible light. Since light itself is energy, then another definition is relevant: light is natureâ€™s way of transferring energy through space</h3>
        <h2>The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. To put that in perspective, when you watch the sun set, it has actually been 10 minutes since that light left the Sun. Light energy is measured with two main sets of units: radiometry measures light power at all wavelengths and photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception. Photometry is useful when measuring light intended for human use. The photometry units are different from most units because they take into account how the human eye responds to light. Based on this, two light sources which produce the same intensity of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. Light exerts a physical pressure on objects in its path. This is explained by the particle nature of light in which photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by the speed of light. The effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects. For example, you can lift a coin with laser pointers, but it would take 1 billion of them to do it. Light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster by working on them like wind pushing a windmill. That is why some scientist are researching solar sails to propel intersteller flight</h2>
        <h1>What is the uses of light energy</h1>
        <h3>It helps us to see things.
It helps plants to make food and grow.
It is used in power satellites and space stations.
It is used in many electronic appliances.
The energy of light from the sun can be harvested to solar panels and can be used for domestic use since it is eco-friendly and cost effective too.</h3>
